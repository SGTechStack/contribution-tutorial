# Branching and Check-In
## Before developing
- Create a main branch
- Create a dev or dev/{brief-description} branch â†’ This is where you start your development.

## During development
- Start off with unit testing
- Followed by integration test

## Raising merge request to main branch for library release
- Ensure you've met the code coverage expectation of 90% before you raise the merge request. (Let us know if your module is urgent, we can temporarily decrease this expectation to 60%-80%).
- Create a merge request to main, assign jun rong/robin as the reviewer.
