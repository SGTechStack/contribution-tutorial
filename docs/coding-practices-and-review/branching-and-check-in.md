# Branching and Check-In
## Before developing
- Create a main branch
- Create a dev or dev/{brief-description} branch â†’ This is where you start your development.

## During development
- Start off with unit testing
- Followed by integration test

:::tip Reference to the following for guides on how to do a unit test with mockito
- [Baeldung - Spring Boot Testing](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-testing)
- [Baeldung - Mockito Series](https://www.baeldung.com/mockito-series)
:::

## Commiting to main branch for release
- Ensure you've met the code coverage expectation of 90% before you check-in. (Let us know if your module is urgent, we can temporarily decrease this expectation to 60%-80%).
- Create a merge request to main, assign me or robin as the reviewer.
