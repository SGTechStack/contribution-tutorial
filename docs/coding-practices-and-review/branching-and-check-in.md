# Branching and Check-In
## Before developing
- Create a main branch
- Create a dev or dev/{brief-description} branch â†’ This is where you start your development.

## Commiting to main branch for release
- Ensure you've met the code coverage expectation of 90% before you check-in. (Let us know if your module is urgent, we can temporarily decrease this expectation to 60%-80%).
- Create a merge request to main, assign me or robin as the reviewer.
